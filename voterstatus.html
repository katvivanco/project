  <p> Article 2. Virginia Voter Registration System.
§ 24.2-404. (Effective until October 1, 2022) Duties of Department of Elections.
A. The Department of Elections shall provide for the continuing operation and maintenance of a central recordkeeping system, the Virginia voter registration system, for all voters registered in the Commonwealth.

In order to operate and maintain the system, the Department shall:

1. Maintain a complete, separate, and accurate record of all registered voters in the Commonwealth.

2. Require the general registrars to enter the names of all registered voters into the system and to change or correct registration records as necessary.

3. Provide to each general registrar voter confirmation documents for newly registered voters and for notice to registered voters on the system of changes and corrections in their registration records and polling places.

4. Require the general registrars to delete from the record of registered voters the name of any voter who (i) is deceased, (ii) is no longer qualified to vote in the county or city where he is registered due to removal of his residence, (iii) has been convicted of a felony, (iv) has been adjudicated incapacitated, (v) is known not to be a United States citizen by reason of reports from the Department of Motor Vehicles pursuant to § 24.2-410.1 or from the Department of Elections based on information received from the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements Program (SAVE Program) pursuant to subsection E, or (vi) is otherwise no longer qualified to vote as may be provided by law. Such action shall be taken no later than 30 days after notification from the Department. The Department shall promptly provide the information referred to in this subdivision, upon receiving it, to general registrars.

5. Retain on the system for four years a separate record for registered voters whose names have been deleted, with the reason for deletion.

6. Retain on the system permanently a separate record for information received regarding deaths, felony convictions, and adjudications of incapacity pursuant to §§ 24.2-408 through 24.2-410.

7. Provide to each general registrar, at least 16 days prior to a general or primary election and three days prior to a special election, an alphabetical list of all registered voters in each precinct or portion of a precinct in which the election is being held in the county, city, or town. These precinct lists shall be used as the official lists of qualified voters and shall constitute the pollbooks. The Department shall provide instructions for the division of the pollbooks and precinct lists into sections to accommodate the efficient processing of voter lines at the polls. Prior to any general, primary, or special election, the Department shall provide any general registrar, upon his request, with a separate electronic list of all registered voters in the registrar's county or city. If electronic pollbooks are used in the locality or electronic voter registration inquiry devices are used in precincts in the locality, the Department shall provide a regional or statewide list of registered voters to the general registrar of the locality. The Department shall determine whether regional or statewide data is provided. Neither the pollbook nor the regional or statewide list of registered voters shall include the day and month of birth of the voter, but shall include the voter's year of birth.

8. Acquire by purchase, lease, or contract equipment necessary to execute the duties of the Department.

9. Use any source of information that may assist in carrying out the purposes of this section. All agencies of the Commonwealth shall cooperate with the Department in procuring and exchanging identification information for the purpose of maintaining the voter registration system. The Department may share any information that it receives from another agency of the Commonwealth with any Chief Election Officer of another state for the maintenance of the voter registration system.

10. Cooperate with other states and jurisdictions to develop systems to compare voters, voter history, and voter registration lists to ensure the accuracy of the voter registration rolls, to identify voters whose addresses have changed, to prevent duplication of registration in more than one state or jurisdiction, and to determine eligibility of individuals to vote in Virginia.

11. Reprint and impose a reasonable charge for the sale of any part of Title 24.2, lists of precincts and polling places, statements of election results by precinct, and any other items required of the Department by law. Receipts from such sales shall be credited to the Board for reimbursement of printing expenses.

B. The Department shall be authorized to provide for the production, distribution, and receipt of information and lists through the Virginia voter registration system by any appropriate means including, but not limited to, paper and electronic means. The Virginia Freedom of Information Act (§ 2.2-3700 et seq.) shall not apply to records about individuals maintained in this system.

C. The State Board shall institute procedures to ensure that each requirement of this section is fulfilled. As part of its procedures, the State Board shall provide that the general registrar shall mail notice of any cancellation pursuant to clause (v) of subdivision A 4 to the person whose registration is cancelled.

D. The State Board shall promulgate rules and regulations to ensure the uniform application of the law for determining a person's residence.

E. The Department shall apply to participate in the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements Program (SAVE Program) operated by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for the purposes of verifying that voters listed in the Virginia voter registration system are United States citizens. Upon approval of the application, the Department shall enter into any required memorandum of agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The State Board shall promulgate rules and regulations governing the use of the immigration status and citizenship status information received from the SAVE Program.

F. The Department shall report annually by October 1 for the preceding 12 months ending August 31 to the Committees on Privileges and Elections on each of its activities undertaken to maintain the Virginia voter registration system and the results of those activities. The Department's report shall be governed by the provisions of § 2.2-608 and shall encompass activities undertaken pursuant to subdivisions A 9 and 10 and subsection E and pursuant to §§ 24.2-404.3, 24.2-404.4, 24.2-408, 24.2-409, 24.2-409.1, 24.2-410, 24.2-410.1, 24.2-427, and 24.2-428. This report shall contain the methodology used in gathering and analyzing the data. The Commissioner of Elections shall certify that the data included in the report is accurate and reliable.

Sess. I, c. 217.
1VAC20-40-70. Applications for voter registration; affirmation of United States citizenship.
A. Applications for voter registration shall be on a form approved by the State Board of Elections or appropriate federal agency.

B. The following omissions are not material and a voter registration application shall not be denied for failure to include one or more of the following:

1. Social security number if the applicant checks the box indicating no SSN was ever issued;

2. Gender;

3. Generational suffix;

4. Middle name if the voter checks the box indicating none;

5. Email address;

6. Daytime telephone number;

7. Response indicating protected voter status, military status, overseas status, or any other information requested in Box 4;

8. Mailing address;

9. State in which the applicant is currently registered if the applicant is currently registered in Virginia;

10. Response indicating interest in serving as an officer of election;

11. Signature of applicant if applicant indicates that he is an individual with physical disabilities;

12. Response indicating the applicant has a physical disability if the application is signed by the applicant; or

13. Date of the application.

C. Middle name may be material to determining eligibility to vote. If the applicant does not include a middle name and does not check the box indicating none, the registrar shall:

1. As far as practical, attempt to contact the applicant and obtain his middle name or lack thereof to determine if the application is complete.

a. If the applicant indicates that he has no middle name, the registrar shall process the application.

b. If the applicant indicates that he has a middle name, the registrar shall inform the applicant that the middle name is required, deny the application, and send the applicant a new application.

2. If the registrar is unable to contact the applicant and therefore unable to determine if the application is incomplete, he shall give the benefit of doubt to the applicant and process the application.

D. A general registrar shall not change information provided by an applicant on an application for voter registration without written authorization signed by the applicant.

E. Persons identified as noncitizens in reports from the Department of Motor Vehicles or other state or federal government sources shall have the opportunity to affirm United States citizenship status using any approved voter registration application or other form containing the required affirmation. The State Board of Elections shall automate the process for requesting affirmation of United States citizenship prior to cancellation.

F. If the individual submitting the application is currently a registered voter in Virginia, then the registrar must process the application as a request to update or change the registered voter's information if the application contains new information and is signed by the voter.

G. For cases not covered by this section, the general registrar in consultation with the Department of Elections shall determine materiality on a case-by-case basis. When this occurs, the Department of Elections shall make recommendations to the State Board of Elections that may result in further amendment of this regulation.

H. General registrars must provide the voter notice of having accepted or denied a voter registration applicant within 30 days of receiving a voter registration application. Days during which registration records are closed before elections pursuant to § 24.2-416 of the Code of Virginia shall not be applicable to the calculation of the 30-day processing time.

I. General registrars may not ask for additional information regarding the applicant's restoration of rights from any applicant who indicates that his voting rights have been restored if the applicant's restoration information appears in the Secretary of the Commonwealth's database accessible to general registrars.

J. Prior versions of any voter registration application shall be accepted for registration. Prior versions of any voter registration application may not be denied for failure to provide information that is deemed not material in this section.

K. If a general registrar receives an application by mail after the voter registration records have been closed pursuant to § 24.2-416 of the Code of Virginia from an applicant who indicates (i) active duty uniformed services member, (ii) spouse or dependent of an active duty uniformed services member, or (iii) overseas citizen status, then the general registrar must contact the applicant to determine whether the applicant qualifies for an extended voter registration deadline. The general registrar may accept information from the applicant indicating that the applicant is qualified either orally or in writing.
